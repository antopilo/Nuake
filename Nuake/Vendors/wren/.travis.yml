# On mac, gcc is aliased to clang, so we only have one row 
# in build the matrix, not two like on linux
compiler:
  - clang
  - gcc

# Automatically build and deploy docs.
jobs:
  include:
    - os: linux
    - os: osx
      env: WREN_TARGET_MAC=1

    - stage: deploy
      script: ./util/deploy_docs_from_travis.sh
      # Only deploy commits that land on main.
      if: branch = main and type = push

# Travis VMs are 64-bit but we compile both for 32 and 64 bit. To enable the
# 32-bit builds to work, we need gcc-multilib.
addons:
  apt:
    packages:
    - gcc-multilib
    - g++-multilib
    # These are needed for building and deploying the docs.
    - python3-markdown
    - python3-pygments
    - python3-setuptools
    - ruby-sass

# Can't do container-based builds for now because installing the custom
# Pygments lexer to generate the docs requires sudo. :( If that changes,
# uncomment the next line and delete the "sudo" and "dist" lines.
# sudo: false # Enable container-based builds.
